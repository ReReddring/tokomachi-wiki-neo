## The purpose of the site

This site was built specifically for recording and translating the contents related to Inui Toko + Hoshimachi Suisei, aka Tokomachi.

So far the site should be up-to-date and awaits for further activities, for now.

Any proofreading, pull requests or code reviews on Github would be welcomed.

This site is also a supplementary for the [History of Tokomachi](/) clip.
