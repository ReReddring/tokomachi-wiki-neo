## The purpose of the site

This site was built specifically for recording and translating the contents related to Inui Toko + Hoshimachi Suisei, aka Tokomachi.

This site is also a supplementary for the [History of Tokomachi (WIP)](/) clip.

### The Contents

The contents came directly from Inui Toko and Hoshimachi Suisei's stream and archives.

It was mostly **translation** and **summarizing** works.

### Keeping the Contents Neutral

Yes, this is also one of the purpose, and it's why I named this _Tokomachi Wiki_.

But me as a big Tokomachi fan, also know clearly it's impossible for me to achieve the purpose alone. It's 100% impossible to keep all the contents neutral as possible during my writings.

So the site / project is also open to the public: if you found any typos, anything missing, or anything inappropriate, you can edit it on GitHub, or contact through Marshmallow.

### Misunderstandings

Don't get it wrong, the purpose of the site was for introduction and let the non-JP communities know more details about why Inui Toko and Hoshimachi Suisei are good / close friends, also how did they influenced each other in music as a _Unit_.

## To-do

So far the site should be up-to-date and awaits for further activities, for now.

```js
/** To-do list */

import Time + Passion from 'Real-life'

function Upcoming_Contents() {
    return (
        // Content
        1. Keep the site up-to-date
        // Code
        1. Make a fancy Homepage including a brief introduction
        2. Refactor the homepage icon & animation
        3. Image lazy-load
    )
}

function Existing_Contents() {
    return (
        // Content
        1. Fact-checking
        2. Proofreading
        3. Audit by the community to keep contents neutral
    )
}

export default Tokomachi-Wiki
```
