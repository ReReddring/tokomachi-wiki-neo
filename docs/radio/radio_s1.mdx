**Full Title:** Tokomachi Radio (Temp)

The radio program was a variety show started by 2 girls chasing their dreams.

The first step was this radio program.

## Episode 01: The Start

<Date D="2020-10-28" />

The first episode, both of them still can't believe it came true. They said this was their first step towards their dreams.

Their dreams were

- Duo radio program
- Duo original songs
- Duo live concerts

They dreamed of singing and dancing together on Toyosu PIT. They succeed in that after a year on [<Fa name={[ 'solid' , 'microphone-lines' ]} /> Suisei's 1st Solo Live](/topics/suisei_galaxy).

They received 300+ letters for their first episode and chose 4 to read.

Toko's conclusion of Suisei: _Singing, Tetris, Psychopath_.

Suisei's conclusion of Toko: _Singing, Night Fishing, Chatting_.

Somehow Tokomachi often got some trouble singing together, because Toko's highest key was way more lower than Suisei's lowest key. This affected their choice on songs singing together.

For them, _Ensemble Stars !!_ was their bible of _how to become an idol_ and their favorite line was _Only love does not make an idol, but without love you would never be an idol._

In the end they re-announced [Toko's 1st solo live](/topics/toko_who_i_am) and announced [their first cover MV](/timeline/2020#first-tokomachi-cover-mv).

## Episode 03

> <YTLink Id="s6OPCzpCep4" />

They were in a event rush at that time. Especially Suisei had 5 lives to attend so they did this episode in a very casual pace.

They were very happy at people started EnSta after watching their performances on Toko's 1st solo live.

They mentioned that they spent a lot of time in the studio practising the dance steps. They also had to record their dance steps to confirm how were they doing before going to studio. So they got a full record from clumsy to masterly, which, they claimed to be a pretty precious memory.

#### Other Topics

The best songs for them were _Ensemble Stars_ songs.

If they are going to have a band, Suisei would be the pianist and Toko would play [<Fa name={[ 'brands' , 'wikipedia-w' ]} /> Shakuhachi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakuhachi).

If they can only eat one kind of food for a year, they choose to eat fried chicken or potato chips.

About the childhood dream job. Suisei's was idol singer and Toko's was Cerberus.

They both lie about their jobs to the barbers.
