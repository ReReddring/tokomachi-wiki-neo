**Full Title:** Tokomachi Radio (Temp)

The radio program was a variety show started by 2 girls chasing their dreams.

The first step was this radio program.

## Episode 01 First Episode

### 2020-10-28

The first episode, both of them still can't believe it came true. They said this was their first step towards their dreams.

Their dreams were

- Duo radio program
- Duo original songs
- Duo live concerts

They dreamed of singing and dancing together on Toyosu PIT. They succeed in that after a year on [<Fa name={[ 'solid' , 'microphone-lines' ]} /> Suisei's 1st Solo Live](/topics/suisei_galaxy).

They received 300+ letters for their first episode and chose 4 to read.

Toko's conclusion of Suisei: _Singing, Tetris, Psychopath_.

Suisei's conclusion of Toko: _Singing, Night Fishing, Chatting_.

Somehow Tokomachi often got some trouble singing together, because Toko's highest key was way more lower than Suisei's lowest key. This affected their choice on songs singing together.

For them, _Ensemble Stars !!_ was their bible of _how to become an idol_ and their favorite line was _Only love does not make an idol, but without love you would never be an idol._

In the end they re-announced [Toko's 1st solo live](/topics/toko_who_i_am) and announced [their first cover MV](/timeline/2020#first-tokomachi-cover-mv).
