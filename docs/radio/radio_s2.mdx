Except being the 14th episode since the program started, this episode was...

- The first episode of 2022
- The first episode of season 2
- The first episode after a 2-month-long gap
- The first episode streamed on the 4th Wednesday of each month since Feburary 2021

Suisei was on a 10-day-long vacation while Toko was just relifed from the rehearsal and preparations of NIJISANJI 4th Anniversary fes (cancelled). Since filtering out the letters to be read was a burden too heavy for only of them them, plus there were too many topics between them for the past few months and for the New Year, they did not accept fan letters this time.
