Suisei announced the guests for her 1st solo live and according to her, both of them are really important to her.

AZKi, the other VTuber / singer affliated to INNK Music, Suisei's colleage. She represents the **Past** of Suisei.

Toko, Suisei's friend, her close partener in music, affliated to NIJISANJI. She represents the **Future** of Suisei.

It was the third time Suisei and Toko singing and dancing together on same live stage.

Suisei said clearly that she would like to forge her future with Toko. Suisei would also break the walls between agencies, even the barriers between Virtual and the Reality. It's the _BREAKTHROUGH_ she had been longing for.

Both Suisei and Toko said few after the live and according to Suisei, she already said too much during the MC part.

Suisei and Toko mentioned they got 2 professional dancers backing them up. Especially [<Fa name={[ 'brands' , 'twitter' ]} /> Araki Yuka](https://twitter.com/araki__yuka), she worked for the live concerts of Kizuna Ai, Hatsune Miku, even LiSA. So Tokomachi won't have to imitate the origianl MV or design their own dance steps from ground zero. The other dancer was [<Fa name={[ 'brands' , 'twitter' ]} /> Mai Itamoto](https://twitter.com/mai_dance_mai).

Suisei also mentioned that comparing to spending hours during "who i am", they spent less time in dance rehearsal this time. They attended the dance lesson for 3 times and rehearsaled for 6 times in total.

The dance steps were designed to not strictly synchronize with each other, but it made Tokomachi's performances even more attractive, especially the pose and light works in the end, it perfectly matched the cover arkwork of _OUT OF FRAME_.
