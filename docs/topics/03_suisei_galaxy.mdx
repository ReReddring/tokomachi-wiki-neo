Suisei announced the guests for her 1st solo live and according to her, both of them are really important to her.

AZKi, the other VTuber / singer affliated to INNK Music, Suisei's colleage. She represents the **Past** of Suisei.

Toko, Suisei's friend, her close partener in music, affliated to NIJISANJI. She represents the **Future** of Suisei.

It was the third time Suisei and Toko singing and dancing together on same live stage.

Suisei said clearly that she would like to forge her future with Toko. Suisei would also break the walls between agencies, even the barriers between Virtual and the Reality. It's the _BREAKTHROUGH_ she had been longing for.
